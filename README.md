This is the Bus mall project assignment for the partial fullfilment of Code-201 Course

- It brings three random images to click on them and will display the result for most viewed and voted results.

- Thank you Rosalyn for commenting on my works and giving me advice and moral support

- Thank you Skyler and Chance for answering all those question again and again
